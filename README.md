# 2D-AdventureGame
A simple 2D adventure game written in python. It is definitely not the brightest idea to create a game in python but I am just testing out architecture, graphics, user interface, collision, physics, audio, artificial intelligence, file formats, databases, tools development, networking, vector math, and animation.
